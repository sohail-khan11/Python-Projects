# Password-Generator
### A Password Generator program to test my learning

Password Generator
This Python program is a simple password generator that allows users to create passwords of varying strength levels. The user can choose between 'weak,' 'medium,' or 'strong' passwords and specify the length and composition of the password.

How to Use:
Run the program, and you'll be prompted to select the desired password strength: 'weak,' 'medium,' or 'strong.'

Depending on your choice, you can customize your password as follows:

Weak Password: Select the desired length for a password consisting of lowercase letters.
Medium Password: Specify the number of letters and digits in the password.
Strong Password: Choose the number of letters, digits, and special symbols in the password.
The program will generate the password according to your preferences and display it in red for easy visibility.

If an invalid input is provided, the program will display a warning message.

Dependencies:
This program uses the random module for generating passwords and the colorama library for adding color to the output.

How to Run:
Ensure you have Python installed on your system, and install the required colorama library using the following command:

pip install colorama
